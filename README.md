Raw raster files (PNG) from openstreetmap.org (zoom 1-10), 2025.5

# Why?

I was not able to find raw raster files available for download. The official site and mirrors only provide 100Gb level whole world downloads, when I only need a very small subset for testing purposes.

_DO NOT SCRAPE openstreetmap.org!_

_I SCRAPED AND SHARED THEM SO THAT YOU DON'T_

# What?

This repo contains the following zoom levels as PNG files:

- level 1: 4 files, 19KiB
- level 2: 16 files, 117KiB
- level 3: 64 files, 336KiB
- level 4: 256 files, 2MiB
- level 5: 1024 files, 6MiB
- level 6: 4096 files, 18MiB
- level 7: 16384 files, 55MiB
- level 8: 65536 files, 173MiB
- level 9: 262144 files, 528MiB
- level 10: 1048576 files, 2GiB

If you use level 10, the map is detailed enough to see districts of major cities, which should be more than enough for test cases.
